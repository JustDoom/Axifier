# Axifier

Have you ever wanted a renewable source of meat? Do you hate killing those poor little animals? Are you a member of PETA but still want to eat meat? Well this mod is for you! Once an animal has grown up you can cleave the meat right off the animal and turn it right back into a baby without the need for killing! It's a renewable source of meat without the hassle of needing to breed and grow crops! Just think of it as stripping a log with your axe, but instead its a living being!

**This is currently in BETA, it has not been tested 100% and there may be bugs**

## Features

- Collect the meat (any drop items) of an animal without killing it
- Turn animals into their baby form (in a very humane way)
- Ride baby pigs or have baby horses with horse armour on them (totally not a bug I thought was good, it's a feature trust me)

### Planned

- Allow or disallow certain mobs from being affected by this mod
- Only drop a portion of the normal drops. Currently the drops act as if the animal died
- Change the amount of damage done to mobs
- Limit how many times they can be cleaved down
- Chance for the animal not to survive the operation :(

## Usage

To use this mod grab any axe and go right click a mob. It only works on mobs with a baby form and if that baby can grow into a baby over time (Works on zombies too). In theory it should also work with mobs from other mods.

This mod at its current state will work purely server side so no client mod is required. Plugin soon???

### Requirements

~~This mod requires the [Architectury API](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api) to be installed along with the mod~~

As of version 1.0.2 this mod no longer requires Architecury API
